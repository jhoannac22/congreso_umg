# Activity Registration Fix Summary

## Problem
When trying to register for an activity (activity ID 14), the system was returning a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing `AttendanceQrCode` Model
**Issue:** The `ActivityRegistration` model referenced a non-existent `AttendanceQrCode` model, causing the application to crash when creating registrations.

**Solution:**
- Created `app/Models/AttendanceQrCode.php` with full functionality
- Created migration `2025_10_16_040337_create_attendance_qr_codes_table.php`
- Ran migration to create the `attendance_qr_codes` table

### 2. Missing `AttendanceReportController`
**Issue:** The API routes referenced a non-existent `AttendanceReportController`, causing route registration errors.

**Solution:**
- Created `app/Http/Controllers/Api/AttendanceReportController.php` with methods:
  - `getStats()` - Get attendance statistics
  - `getReports()` - Get attendance reports with filtering
  - `generateActivityReport()` - Generate detailed activity reports

### 3. Missing Relationship Loading in Email Sending
**Issue:** When sending the registration confirmation email, the `$registration` object didn't have its relationships loaded, which could cause lazy loading issues.

**Solution:**
- Added `$registration->load(['activity', 'participant']);` before sending the email in `ActivityController@register`

## Files Created

1. **app/Models/AttendanceQrCode.php**
   - Full model with relationships and QR code generation logic
   - Methods: `createForRegistration()`, `isValid()`, `markAsUsed()`

2. **app/Http/Controllers/Api/AttendanceReportController.php**
   - Controller for attendance statistics and reporting
   - Public endpoints for viewing attendance data

3. **database/migrations/2025_10_16_040337_create_attendance_qr_codes_table.php**
   - Migration for attendance_qr_codes table
   - Fields: registration_id, activity_id, participant_id, code, qr_data, is_used, used_at, expires_at

## Files Modified

1. **app/Http/Controllers/Api/ActivityController.php**
   - Added relationship loading before sending email (line 409)
   - Ensures `activity` and `participant` relationships are loaded on `$registration`

## Verification

The registration endpoint was tested successfully:
- **Endpoint:** POST `/api/v1/activities/14/register`
- **Request Body:** `{"participant_id": 1, "notes": "Test registration"}`
- **Response Status:** 200 OK
- **Result:** Registration created successfully

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   ```
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Chrome/Edge)
   - Clear cached images and files
   ```

2. **Test Registration:**
   - Navigate to `/activities`
   - Click on any activity
   - Click "Registrarse" or "Inscribirse"
   - Fill in the registration form
   - Click "Confirmar Inscripción"
   - Should see success message

3. **Verify in Database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM activity_registrations WHERE participant_id = 1 AND activity_id = 14;
   SELECT * FROM attendance_qr_codes WHERE participant_id = 1;
   ```

## Additional Notes

- All migrations have been run successfully
- All caches have been cleared
- The system is now fully operational for activity registrations
- Email notifications are wrapped in try-catch to prevent failures from blocking registrations

## Commands Run

```bash
# Created missing files and migrations
php artisan make:migration create_attendance_qr_codes_table
php artisan migrate

# Cleared all caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan optimize:clear
```

## Testing Results

✅ Activity 14 exists and is active
✅ Participant 1 exists and is valid
✅ Registration endpoint responds with 200 OK
✅ Registration record created successfully
✅ QR code generation is functional
✅ Email sending is wrapped in error handling

The system is now ready for use!
